# Evention Shop

## About

Is an online store management system. It is Laravel-based, using a MySQL database and Vue.js. Support is provided for different languages and currencies.

## What is it? What better?

Nothing better yet, but I'm looking for the best. Its my first "big" project on Laravel and first usage Vue.js. I'm studying these two frameworks for new experiences.

## Get started

The installation is the same as Laravel, but for now you need to download the repository or make a clone. After you need to run the command:

`composer update`

And then `npm install`, and you can use this project.

Will be supplemented...
